    <p class = "yellow">spare time can be stressful, and i don't think that's usually the expectation. but, if your spare time is fleeting, and after so much activity and work you're allowed to relax, how do you relax.... with efficiency? maybe there's something wrong in the way we think about our time.</p>
    <p class = "red">college especially has thrown this issue of 'productive' relaxation in my face, and i recently watched a video essay that sums it up fairly well. no, it's not a new thing to fall into an anti-capitalist ideological hole as a college student, but there are still valuable life lessons that seems to be missing from most media forms these days.</p>
    <p>here's the video:</p>
    <!--below i embedded a video file and found a youtube thumbnail finder to import for the thumbnail pic. I couldn't figure out how to make a youtube URL active embed work with the thumbnail, every promising result looked like it required the youtube API, unfortunately-->

    <p class = 'green'>In the spirit of this, here are some pages pulled straight out of my sketchbook: they're not for anything and will never be used as a means to an end (except for this little webpage mockup, i suppose.) I made them because drawing and painting are fun ways to spend my time. <br>
    <br>
despite this idea i still find myself wanting to become an artist of some kind and be able to devote my life to it. as much as that could be a possibility (albeit, an easy track to becoming a starving artist), i'd lose other interests that i like too; namely learning all i can about science. so it's a difficult balance. </p>
